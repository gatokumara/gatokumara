## Professional Summary
Web developer with 6 years of proven experience through my UpWork profile, which features numerous completed projects and positive reviews, including long-term assignments that extended over 2 years. I have worked with various technologies, from low-code tools to popular languages such as TypeScript, Python, and PHP.

I offer ready-to-deliver fullstack solutions through proprietary templates, allowing projects to start with agility and quality. My work philosophy consists of coding only what's necessary and using specialized tools to handle the heavy lifting.

In the past, I successfully contributed to generating six-figure revenues by adding new features to existing systems and codebases, thanks to my ability to read legacy code, quickly understand challenges, and prototype precise solutions.

Currently, I prefer working on new projects that allow me to gather the best tools for the job. I develop code using the Next.js framework, integrating APIs and combining accessible low-code tools, such as Airtable and Auth0, to build exceptional and easily maintainable projects.
